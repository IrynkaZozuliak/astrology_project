            <h1>What Can the Stars Say?</h1>
            <h2>What is your life’s potential? ​How can you ​align yourself with ​the ​stars energies to feel more
                 in tune and more connected to what’s going on inside and outside of you?</h2>
            <p>Far too often healing is geared towards elevating attributes that are deemed valuable by the status
                 quo. I believe that what makes us different informs our humanity and that our humanity is our greatest
                  asset. I believe that what we have survived can eventually help us to thrive. I believe that we all 
                  have within us the wisdom that we need at any and every moment. Sometimes we need a guide to get there,
                   other times we do it all on our own. I offer what I know in hopes that it stimulates and awakens 
                   others’ ability to access their own wisdom.</p>
